name: Python CI  # name is indicating what our workflow is called

# trigger the workflow on any push to the main branch or pull request
# we define some events (e.g., push, pull, merge, delete â€” based on this event we can trigger workflow)
# first we write `on:` then define events; in project we can define multiple branches

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

# then jobs: we can have multiple jobs; we run entire job on ubuntu container
# you can also use windows, mac containers

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # run on ubuntu environment

    # then every workflow step we define it in the block
    steps:
      # step 1: check out the code from repository
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # step 2: set up python environment
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'  # specify the python version you want to use

      # step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # step 4: Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
